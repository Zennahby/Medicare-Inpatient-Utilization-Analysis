Where are these risks structurally concentrated, and where do policy or system-level interventions matter most?

1.Expected Bed Days per Capita (State Level): What it answers
“Which states are most strained relative to population?”

2. Average Payment per Discharge (State Level): What it answers
“Are states expensive because care costs more, or because more care is delivered?

3. Share of State Bed Days Concentrated in Top 10% of Providers: 
It measures system fragility, not just utilization.
What it answers
“Is inpatient capacity spread across many hospitals, or dangerously concentrated in a few?”


AMONG THE TOP D STATES BY DISCHARGE, FLORIDA, CALIFORNIA, TEXAS, NY, AND ILLINOIS WHICH ARE ARGUABLY THE TOP 5 STATES BY POPULATION, CA AND TX HAVE LOW EXPECTED BED DAYS PER 1000 RESIDENTS 657 AND 757 RESPECTIVELY WHILE FL, NY AND IL HAVE HIGH EXPECTED BED DAYS PER 1000 RESIDENTS 1212, 1047 AND 1147 RESPECTIVELY

ON THE OTHER HAND, UTAH, HAWAI, COLORADO AND OREGON HAVE THE LOWEST EXPECTED BED DAYS PER 1000 RESIDENTS 445, 456 509 550 RESPECTIVELY HAVE LESS THAN 1 MILLION TOTAL DISCHARGES BUT HAVE FAIRLY GOOD POULATIONS OVER 1 MILLION RESIDENTS

26 OF THE 51 STATES HAVE EXPECTED BED DAYS PER 1000 RESIDENTS THAT IS ABOVE AVERAGE. DE HAS THE HIGHEST BUT HAS DISCHARGE OF 429768 AND POPULATION 989948 


ALASKA 25K, HAWAI 22K, MARYLAND 22K, CALIFORNIA 22K NEWYORK 21K AND OREGON 20K SIT AT THE TOP  FOR THE STATES WITH THE HIGHEST PAYMENT PER DISCHARGE.

# **State-Level Strategic Analysis: Capacity vs. Cost Intensity**

## **Executive Summary**

This final phase of the project shifts from raw totals to **normalized metrics**. By accounting for population size and cost-per-case, we expose the difference between **volume-driven pressure** and **structural inefficiency**. This analysis identifies where stakeholders must act to prevent capacity collapse or unsustainable spending.

## Key Analytical Questions

- Which states experience the greatest inpatient capacity pressure relative to population?

- Are states expensive because they deliver more care, or because each hospitalization costs more?


## 1. *Analyzing Expected Bed Days per 1,000 Residents*

While total volume often mirrors population, per-capita normalization reveals which states are truly "strained" regardless of their size.

**Structural Capacity Pressure**

![Expected Bed Days per 1,000 Residents](<../VISUALIZATIONS/Expected _Inpatient_Bed_Day_Per_1000residents.png>)

* **The Structural Risks:** Florida (1,212), Illinois (1,147), and New York (1,017.17) show substantially higher per-capita bed days. This signals that utilization pressure in these high-volume states is structural and intense, rather than purely a result of being populous.

**The Extreme Outlier**: Delaware (DE) represents the most severe capacity strain in the nation, recording the highest expected bed stay at 1,595.46 per 1,000 residents. Despite a population under 1 million, its utilization intensity creates a disproportionate burden on state infrastructure.

* **The Scaled Efficiency:** Large states like **California (676.66)** and **Texas (757.00)** exhibit relatively low per-capita bed days. Their healthcare burden is a factor of **size**, not high intensity.

* **The Efficient Benchmarks:** States like **Utah**, **Hawaii**, and **Colorado** maintain the lowest utilization, reflecting less inpatient-dependent care models.

## 2. *Analyzing Average Medicare Payment per Discharge*

**Inpatient Cost Intensity**  
![Average Medicare Payment per Discharge](<../VISUALIZATIONS/State_Avg_Payment_per_Discharge.png>)


By removing volume, we answer one decisive question: **How expensive is the average stay?**

* **High-Cost Clusters:** **Alaska (~$25K)**, **Hawaii (~$22K)**, and **California (~$22K)** lead the nation in cost intensity. These values sit well above the national average of **~$16.4K**, driven by geographic isolation, high labor costs, and clinical complexity.
* **Low-Cost Clusters:** **Vermont (~$12K)**, **Florida (~$13K)**, **Alabama (~$13K)**, and **Mississippi (~$13K)** record the lowest payments. These states handle high volume but at a significantly **lower operating costs and less resource-intensive inpatient care**.
---


## **The Strategic Gap: Cost vs. Capacity**

The intersection of these two visuals creates a roadmap for targeted intervention:


- **High Strain / High Cost States**: **New York, California** pose a  systemic insolvency and bed shortages risk. **Aggressive Value-Based Care** will help move patients to outpatient settings faster. 

- **the High Strain / Low Cost market** **Florida, North Carolina** fall into this category with the risk of Resource "burnout" due to high volume at low margins. **Investing in Capacity Expansion** and nursing retention programs can alleviate the strain

- **Low Strain/High Cost Market**: **Alaska, Hawaii** this is as a result of geographic and logistical cost barriers. More of **Telehealth & Remote Monitoring** will reduce the need for high-cost admissions. |

## **Stakeholder Risk Mitigation**

### **For Payers (Insurance & Government)**

* **Target Intensity, Not Volume:** In high-cost states (Alaska/Hawaii), standard benchmarks are irrelevant. Adjust reimbursement for geographic isolation to maintain network stability.
* **Normalize Risk:** Use per-capita data to identify "hotspots" where utilization is trending higher than population growth predicts.

### **For Providers (Hospital Systems)**

* **Capacity Management:** If in a high-intensity state (Nebraska/Connecticut), focus on **discharge planning** and reducing "Expected Bed Days" to avoid permanent boarders in the ER.
* **Cost Control:** High-cost providers must audit their case-mix complexity to ensure they are being compensated for the resource intensity of their patients.

## **The Bottom Line**

> "Cost and capacity require different policy levers. I’ve proven that some states are capacity-strained but low-cost, while others are high-cost but clinically efficient. By separating volume from intensity, we can target the **structural causes** of healthcare spend rather than just treating the symptoms of population size."
